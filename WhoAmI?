<h3>Personal Life</h3>
<p>I grew up in West Michigan orginally moving from Mission, Texas in 2001. My parents Orginally from Mexico meant <br>
that I did not learn how to speak English until I moved to Michigan. I am the second youngest out of 4 children. My older <br>
brother is 13 years older than me and with my sister is there is a 9 years difference, which meant that I related more with <br>
my younger brother who is only 1 year younger. Kiyoshi and I have been know to have gotten into trouble,which most of the time <br>
involved having lit something on fire or having to cover up a car accident from my parents.At the moment Kiyoshi is living in Colorado <br>
until he returns from school in May, so until then, nothing will be lit on fire. One thing that we share is our love for cars, my brother <br>
has always been really good at negotiates when it comes to buying cars. Together we purchased a BMW 530i. The orginal deal was that he got <br>
to drive it on the weekends, but work sometimes did not let that happen.
